# ESP3A-Class-AB-Audio-Amplfier
This project reverse engineers and simulates the ESP P3a 100W Class AB amplifier. I analyzed each analog stage, tuned biasing in LTSpice, and validated performance on a Â±10V breadboard before designing a custom 2-layer PCB in KiCad as part of senior-level coursework.
